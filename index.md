**People Prefer, We generate!** A brand new aesthetically oriented music-dance dataset: PopDanceSet, combined with POPDG, let's generate the most popular dances of the moment!

  <h1>Abstract</h1>
</div>

<div class="justify">
  Generating dances that are both lifelike and well-aligned with music continues to be a challenging task in the cross-modal domain. This paper introduces PopDanceSet, the first dataset tailored to the preferences of young audiences, enabling the generation of aesthetically oriented dances. And it surpasses the AIST++ dataset in music genre diversity and the intricacy and depth of dance movements. Moreover, the proposed POPDG model within the iDDPM framework enhances dance diversity and, through the Space Augmentation Algorithm, strengthens spatial physical connections between human body joints, ensuring that increased diversity does not compromise generation quality. A streamlined Alignment Module is also designed to improve the temporal alignment between dance and music. Extensive experiments show that POPDG achieves SOTA results on two datasets. Furthermore, the paper also expands on current evaluation metrics. The dataset and code are available at <a href="https://github.com/Luke-Luo1/POPDG">https://github.com/Luke-Luo1/POPDG</a>.

  <h1>PopDanceSet</h1>
</div>

<div class="justify">
  We have constructed the PopDanceSet, a database of popular dances loved by the masses, by building a popularity function to filter hot dance videos from <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/v/dance/">Bilibili</a> (China's most popular video platform among young people). Below are a few rendered examples of dance genres from the PopDanceSet:

<div class="justify">
  The core creative points of POPDG include three main aspects: the first is to enhance the spatial connection between various joints of the upper body and the root joint (in SMPL format) through the Space Augmentation Algorithm(in DS-Attention); the second is to maintain a balance between the quality and diversity of dance generation using iDDPM; and the third is to design a streamlined Alignment Module to enhance the match between music and dance.

  <h1>Video Demo(In memory of the author of Dragon Ball, Mr. Toriyama Akira 鳥山 明)</h1>
</div>

<div class="justify">
  In early March this year, my favorite manga author, Mr. Akira Toriyama（鳥山 明）, who created "Dragon Ball," passed away. Therefore, I used the OP and ED songs from the Dragon Ball anime as background music, and the dances generated by them as demos, to commemorate Mr. Akira Toriyama!

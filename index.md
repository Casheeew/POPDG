# Abstract

Generating dances that are both lifelike and well-aligned with music continues to be a challenging task in the cross-modal domain. This paper introduces PopDanceSet, the first dataset tailored to the preferences of young audiences, enabling the generation of aesthetically oriented dances. And it surpasses the AIST++ dataset in music genre diversity and the intricacy and depth of dance movements. Moreover, the proposed POPDG model within the iDDPM framework enhances dance diversity and, through the Space Augmentation Algorithm, strengthens spatial physical connections between human body joints, ensuring that increased diversity does not compromise generation quality. A streamlined Alignment Module is also designed to improve the temporal alignment between dance and music. Extensive experiments show that POPDG achieves SOTA results on two datasets. Furthermore, the paper also expands on current evaluation metrics. The dataset and code are available at [https://github.com/Luke-Luo1/POPDG](https://github.com/Luke-Luo1/POPDG).

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
